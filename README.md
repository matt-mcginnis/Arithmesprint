# README

This is a web application I am currently working on as my final project for 
Tech Talent South's Code Immersion Bootcamp. The application is a sort of 
social media / learning platform hybrid. I intend to have it so users can sign 
up, make posts and challenge friends to arithmetic sprints in the categories of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and comprhensive (all categories 
combined).
