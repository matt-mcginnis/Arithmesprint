# README

This is a web application I am currently working on as my final project for 
Tech Talent South's Code Immersion Bootcamp. The application is a sort of 
social media / learning platform hybrid. I intend to have it so users can sign 
up, make posts and challenge friends to arithmetic sprints in the categories of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and comprhensive (all categories 
combined).

If you are interested in cloning or forking this repository and testing things 
out, here are some basic pieces of information to get you started.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby 2.5.1

* Rails 5.1

* Depending on your system, you may have to install some extra dependencies. To 
install Ruby and Rails, please refer to the following links.

Rails Resource: https://installrails.com/  
RVM Resource: https://rvm.io/rvm/install  
Ruby Resource: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/ 

* To initialize the database for the app, once you have cloned it change into the 
directory and run the following commands:

rails db:migrate  
rails db:seed

* Once the database has been initialized, you can view the web application locally 
by running the command "rails s" in your terminal and visiting https://localhost:3000 
in your web browser.

If you have any questions or suggestions about the app, please feel free to send me an 
email or submit a request!
